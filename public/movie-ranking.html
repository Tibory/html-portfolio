<h2>The 3 best movies according to Tibor</h2>
<h3>Goodfellas</h3>
<p>I like movies about mafia stories. Just as i liked the Mafia game when i was young. <br/>
     It made a big impact on my mindset to not sell your friends and 
      -of course- i always wore suit when i could. </p>
<h3>Silence of the lambs </h3>
<p>A Really, really cool movie. </p>
<p>I remember when we watched it with my girlfriend, she was scared so much!</p>
<h3>The Godfather 1-3</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film, with a lot of insights if you push where you can get but...</p>
<p> let me share a quote with you here from the Mafia game: <br/>
    "Yeah, balance, that's the right word. Cause the guy who wants too much <br/>
    risks losing absolutely everything. 
      Of course, the one who wants too little from life might not get anything at all."  <br/>
